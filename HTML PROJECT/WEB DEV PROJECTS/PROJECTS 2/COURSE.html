    My Favorite Courses includes:-
    <ol type="1">
        <li><b><u>Web Technology</u></b></li>
        Web Technology in this fast evolving technological evolution is becoming very lucrative due to the fact that
        many businesses, emterprises, agencies and organizations are going digital and as such they would be in need for
        web designers to help build best websites to the client's satisfaction. <br>
        <li><b><u>Cyber Security</u></b></li>
        Cyber Security is now the talk of the day, this is involved with the fact that the internet is becoming unsafe
        on a daily basis and as such there is high demand for cyber Security skills such as <b><i>Network Security
                Analysts, Penetration testers, Bug Bounties</i></b> to improve the network/ site security for safe
        operations by internet users. <br>
        <li><b><u>Software Development</u></b></li>
        In this era of technological and digital andvancement, Software development is not left out due to the fact that
        it involves creating/ building softwares either from scratch or templates using various libraries, tools, and
        programming languages to help minimize bugs and also give the user a hitch-free experience using the software.
        <br> Software development is also a highly sort-out skill that is on-demand by both national and international
        clients around the world. <br>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Among these courses, I would gladly chose Cyber Security if I were given the opportunity to chose, this is
        because
        the world is really going digital and devices are fast becoming compromised in the hands of <b>Black hat / Gray
            Hat
            hackers</b>, so I would love to study cyber Security so as to contribute my own quota in creating awareness
        about
        the
        fast raising dangers involved with &nbsp; compromised network devices and how to mitigate them.
